A ruby implementation of Node's [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) package.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'class_name', github: 'invisiblehats/class_name'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install class_name

## Usage

You can use this in any ruby environment. Test it out in your terminal:

```ruby
require 'class_name'

include ClassName

class_name("ui card", { fluid: false, flexbox: true, float: false }, ["blue", "inverted"])
# "ui card flexbox blue inverted"
```

### Rails

Add this line to `ApplicationHelper`:
```ruby
module ApplicationHelper
  include ClassName
end
```

Then use it in your view templates:
```html
<div class="<%= class_name('ui card', fluid: false, { blue: true }) %>"></div>
```

Would generate:
```html
<div class="ui card blue"></div>
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
